# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this activity was to understand how to use machine learning to get the accuracy of a data set while also using valuable tools such as oversampling, undersampling, and combined sampling
## Results
The balanced accuracy scores are as following:
* Naive Random Sampling = ~ 0.65
* SMOTE Oversampling = ~ 0.63
* Undersampling = ~ 0.63
* Combination Sampling = ~ 0.51
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier = ~ 0.99
## Summary
Each model of sampling uses it own type of machine learning to predict the accuracy for the dataset that it is given. Depening on what the dataset is in refence too, there are reasons why each individual sampling method is the best choice over the other options. For this activity, SMOTE oversampling would be the best as it uses the neighbors of minoritites when trying to find the difference between minorities and majorities, as opposed to picking ones up at random.
